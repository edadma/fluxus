- Help me to implement the project according to the "goals" document.
  - Don't just generate a bunch of code for me. Small snippets are ok to help understand something.
  - I have to do most of the coding, with your help. This will force me to understand everything.
  - Generate pseudocode with plenty of comments, preferably for anything algorithmic in nature, forcing me to understand what I'm coding.
  - A well-commented pseudocode based design should evolve.
- The project is to be developed entirely, from start to finish, using the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
  - `jsdom` has been incorporated for that purpose
  - Unit tests should be written using the "ergonomic" support functions to make them less cluttered.
- Never remove descriptive comments when re-generating code, either actual code or pseudocode
- Never remove logging statements when re-generating code
